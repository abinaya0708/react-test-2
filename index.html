        1.What is hook?write one example...

        Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.
         Hooks don't work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.
         Example:
         import React,{useState} from "react";

         export const hook=()=>{
            const[name,setname]=useState("Abinaya")
            return(
                < div>
                    < h1>{setname("akalya")}< /h1>
                < /div>
            )
         }
         ------------------------------------------------------------------------

         2.What is props?

         In ReactJS, the props are a type of object where the value of attributes of a tag is stored. The word “props” implies “properties”, and its working functionality is quite similar to HTML attributes.
          Basically, these props components are read-only components.
          Props is an object.
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------
         3.What is State?

         The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.
          A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.


          -------------------------------------------------------------------------

          4.Difference between function component and class component?

          Functional components are written as a JavaScript function. Class components are written as a JavaScript class. Functional components do not have a state or lifecycle methods. 
          Class components have a state and can implement lifecycle methods like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.

          ------------------------------------------------------------------------

          5.Write a example for state update---

          import React,{useState} from "react";

         export const hook=()=>{
            const[name,setname]=useState("Abinaya")
            return(
                < div>
                    < h1>{setname("akalya")}< /h1>
                < /div>
            )
         }
         ------------------------------------------------------------------------
